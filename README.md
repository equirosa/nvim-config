# Kiri's Neovim Configuration

This is my own configuration for Neovim, I'll try to mix in some Nix stuff here and there to help manage packages that the plugins might need.

## Neovim from scratch

This config is based on Chris@Machine's work on configuring Neovim to be more IDE-like. Honestly the only reason I'm doing my own thing is because I like fiddling around with stuff. So, if you want a streamlined experience, go check out either the [original repo](https://github.com/LunarVim/Neovim-from-scratch) or straight up use [LunarVim](https://www.lunarvim.org/), Chris's personalized layer.

Each video will be associated with a branch so checkout the one you are interested in, you can follow along with this [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctH-a-1eUME&list=PLhoH5vyxr6Qq41NFL4GvhFp-WLd5xzIzZ).
